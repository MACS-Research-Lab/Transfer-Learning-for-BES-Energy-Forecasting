**_:calendar: Tue, Jun 6_**

_Ideas or Plan_

- [x] Preprocess ESB data for both cooling towers
- [x] Create some generalized preprocessing functions (missing data removal, outlier removal)
- [x] Decide on which column to set a target for predictions

**_:calendar: Wed, Jun 7_**

_Ideas or Plan_

- [x] Preprocess Kissam to check variable correlations with ESB
- [x] Compare variables across ESB and Kissam

> **Brainstorming**:<br/>
> Current approach - I've been trying to consolidate data for all cooling towers of a building into a single dataset for that building.<br/>
> Problem - Different buildings have different numbers of cooling towers so I haven't been able to come up with a definite generalized approach to do this yet.<br/>
> New approach idea - Now I'm thinking that instead of trying to approach this as transferring a model for one building onto another, approach it as transferring a model of one cooling tower onto another (so if a building has two cooling towers treat these independently)<br/>
> Potential problems with new approach: A building may alternate between using its cooling towers, so any individual cooling tower would appear to be off for long period thereby leading to misrepresentative data<br/>

## **Week 3**

**_:calendar: Mon, Jun 12_**

_Ideas or Plan_

- [x] Use ESB1_summer_lstm_model trained on ESB cooling tower 1 on ESB cooling tower 2 (without any retraining)

**_:calendar: Tue, Jun 13_**

_Ideas or Plan_

- [x] Change lstm preprocessing method of handling off data
- [x] Reverse normalize predicted data
- [x] Clean up ESB Summer LSTM preprocessing

> **Disclaimer**:<br/>
> Timesteps jumps have been appropriately removed while handling cases where data was removed due to the cooling tower being off, but not in cases of data removal due to outliers/missing data.<br/>
> Since outliers and missing data for ESB were previously removed in the esb_preprocessing file, timestep jumps due to these will only constitute a very small portion of the data (since outliers and missing data constituted <0.1% of all the data), so I have not changed my outlier and missing data handling methods.<br/>

Next steps?

1. Simulate the two different forms of data availability discussed in the paper? or state actual data availability?
   - Random data points throughout the year being available
   - Many data points over a certain month period being available, but none at all of other months
     Ans: State actual data availability
2. Use performance improvement ratio? Done.
   - (RMSE_old - RMSE_new) / RMSE_old
3. Predict 1 hour away

5. Inter-season inter-building transfers between summer and fall
