# Transfer learning of data-driven models for energy performance analysis

### **:pushpin: Objectives**:

- Use data-driven tools to analyze the building operating modes and factors affecting energy consumption.
- Analyze the influence of training data amount availability and quality on prediction performance.
- Benchmark transfer learning mechanisms for cross-building data-driven short-term energy predictions.

### **:pushpin: Project tasks**:

**Week 1-2**

[ ] Collect and curate/organize the data for two/more buildings (Potentially Alumni Hall, ESB, Kissam)

**Week 3**

[ ] Collect and organize weather data corresponding to the same date interval.

**Week 4**

[ ] Derive common variables available across buildings

**Week 4-6**

[ ] Conduct exploratory data analysis and data processing through visualization, outlier removal, missing data imputation, and clustering, to determine operating modes that affect the energy consumption. Analyze common modes of operation based on weather conditions.

**Week 7**

[ ] Train/Validate a set of data-driven predictive energy models for each building with complete datasets

**Week 8**

[ ] Analyze the influence of training data amount availability and quality on prediction performance for each model.<br/>
[ ] Select transfer learning mechanisms to be tested.

**Week 9**

[ ] Benchmark/compare the effectiveness of transfer learning mechanisms to reduce the amount/quality of data required
