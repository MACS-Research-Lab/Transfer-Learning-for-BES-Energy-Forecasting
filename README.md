# HVAC Model Problem for MACS

- **Spring 2023 Works:** [ESB Tower 1 Time-Series Model for Cooling Tower Efficiency](./archive/) made using sklearn (later added a model made using LSTM with keras in the summer)
- **Summer 2023 Works:** Transfer learning model for energy performance analysis

# Transfer learning of data-driven models for energy performance analysis

### **:pushpin: Objectives**:

- Use data-driven tools to analyze the building operating modes and factors affecting energy consumption.
- Analyze the influence of training data amount availability and quality on prediction performance.
- Benchmark transfer learning mechanisms for cross-building data-driven short-term energy predictions.

### **:pushpin: Project tasks**:

**Week 1-2**

- [ ] Collect and curate/organize the data for two/more buildings (ESB, Kissam, MRB)

**Week 3**

- [ ] Collect and organize weather data corresponding to the same date interval.

**Week 4**

- [ ] Derive common variables available across buildings

**Week 4-6**

- [ ] Conduct exploratory data analysis and data processing through visualization, outlier removal, missing data imputation, and clustering, to determine operating modes that affect the energy consumption. Analyze common modes of operation based on weather conditions.

**Week 7**

- [ ] Train/Validate a set of data-driven predictive energy models for each building with complete datasets

**Week 8**

- [ ] Analyze the influence of training data amount availability and quality on prediction performance for each model.<br/>
- [ ] Select transfer learning mechanisms to be tested.

**Week 9-10**

- [ ] Benchmark/compare the effectiveness of transfer learning mechanisms to reduce the amount/quality of data required
